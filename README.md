# ag-pictgen
Attribute Grammar picture generator

# About ag-pictgen
Ag-pictgen is a small tool for generating Attribute Grammar pictures in tikz format (http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/).
It is used by the UUAGC (http://foswiki.cs.uu.nl/foswiki/HUT/AttributeGrammarSystem) tutorial.
The package is extracted from the repo https://svn.science.uu.nl/repos/project.STEC.uuagc where
the tutorial can be found, to allow independent use.
For now, there is no documentation, but the `examples` subdir contains an example `cons_toc.ppd` (and its use in `cons_toc_use.tex`)
